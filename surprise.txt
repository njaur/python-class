1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?

"ls" lets you see your directories
"git clone" allows you to paste a url at the end and clone a repo from github 
"python3" allows you to write in code and test it quickly which we've done mostly using numbers(int and float) as well as words(strings). 
It is in bash I think(unless its python).

My family has a Maltese dog named Milly.

To copy past/google my error and troubleshoot from there.
